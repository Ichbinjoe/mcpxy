This kid called me wrong on the Internet once. Their claim?

```
Without a good netty implementation for other languages it doesn't make sense to
write (Minecraft) proxies in other languages (compared to Java).
```

Fueled by the desire to prove said individual wrong, I set out to create:

# mcpxy

Its yet another Minecraft proxy, this time written in C++. Because #gottagofast.

I literally have nothing else to say about this for the time being.

## License

Idk, MIT is usually a pretty dope license for open source projects. Lets make it
that!

You can find a copy of the license in [LICENSE](./LICENSE).
